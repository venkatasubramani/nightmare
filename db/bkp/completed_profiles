She is my inspiration and my greatest support. She is a very talented, honest,sensible, an admirably simple and a simply admirable personality. She is kind and polite and yet strong and pragmatic. She is an independent and broad minded girl with moral values acquired from me :P She got placed in a MNC and started working for it.Now she is following her passion for civil services and cleared the prelims and the mains exams and she wishes to pursue it in future. That is all that elders at home allow me to talk about her. But here comes the top secret- she is a foodie and locates landmarks in Chennai only with restaurants. We used to own a dog whom my sister used to call by so many funny names that can make your ribs crack. Also somehow most of the kids i try to enroll in my party end up enrolling in the attractive opposition party ( she probably bribes them). She loves travelling and according to kids, peers and elders- she is very interesting company :D Ya, i must admit she is fun. She loves to go out for a walk, enjoys nature, taps her feet to music. She taught me a lot of subject when i was in school and she is pretty good at it. She was a jack of all trades in school- academics, sports, arts. She is street smart and is a trusted adviser for family and friends. And finally she still fights with me and will go mad once she wakes up in the morning and finds out what i have done to her profile and exclaim ''Like i said, thats why one should never let the small ones interfere in such matters!'' :D Less...","name":"Bhavani","age":"26","height_feet":"5","height_inch":"5","weight":"61 Kgs / 134  lbs","mother_tongue":"Telugu","maritial_status":"Never married","body_type":"Average","complexion":"Fair","physical_status":"Normal","eating_habit":"Eggetarian","drinking_habit":"Never drinks","smoking_habit":"Never smokes","religion":"Hindu","caste":"Naidu (Caste No Bar) / Velama","country":"India","state":"Tamil Nadu","city":"","citizenship":"India","resident_status":"Chennai","education":"B.Tech.","education_detail":"MBA","occupation":"Student","occupation_detail":"Not Specified","employed_in":"Not working","annual_income":"Not Specified","family_status":"Upper middle class","father_status":"Joint Commissioner (Retd)","mom_status":"Home maker","brothers":"1 / 1 Married","sisters":"1 / Not Married","about_family":"My dad is retired joint commissioner, commercial tax dept Chennai , currently one of the conveners in a NGO, my mom - the best cook and keeps low our bad cholesterol levels, she holds a MA degree in public administration, my elder brother- a Group manager in HCL and my sister in law- a senior consultant in Juniper networks, they both make a  happy and loving family completed with my naughty little niece who is presently in charge of my sisters heart.

I did my undergrad education from VIT University, Vellore and interned at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai for 6 months. I moved to Baltimore, USA to pursue my Master's and stayed on to begin my Ph.D. I am currently working on my doctoral dissertation which is a collaborative research project between three institutions - University of Maryland Baltimore County (my school), Johns Hopkins University and National Institute of Health.  Professionally I hope to get into research in biology after completion of my Ph.D.  \n\nHaving transitioned from living in a small town to do my Ph.D in the US, I respect traditional values as well as have a modern outlook and enjoy being independent. Apart from academics, I am passionate about dancing and art work. I am not a very outdoor kind of person, but I enjoy playing light badminton once in a while. I like traveling and hanging out with friends. I am a calm and composed person who may seem reserved initially, but can get chattery once I am comfortable with somebody. I am very flexible in nature and adapt quickly to new places and people. \n\nI am looking for a partner who is understanding , respects my interests and decisions, and is a friendly and enthusiastic companion.
