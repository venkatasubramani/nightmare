I have a Masters in Biomedical Engineering and I'm currently working for UT Arlington, USA. \nSome of the adjectives my beloved ones use, to describe me would be these: reliable, straight-forward, caring, affectionate and mischievous. I think they are right :)\n I love my family the most and they mean everything to me. I'm an avid nature lover. I try my best to keep the environment clean. Some of my hobbies include reading novels, building miniature doll houses, puzzles and cooking. I'm pretty good at cooking Indian and Chinese. I'm looking forward to learning terrace gardening and also planning to grow fruits and veggies preferably in my own backyard garden.\nI crave learning new things and prefer keeping myself occupied most of the times... Caring and sharing make life sweeter, according to me and I have grown up seeing a beautiful bond between my parents. I would like my life partner to be someone who thinks along the same lines, who is kind-hearted, down to earth and broad minded. I would gladly travel along with him as a supportive friend and make our journey a blissful and satisfactory one! \nThanks for reading through my profile and good luck on your soul mate search. \nP.S: Smokers please ignore my profile and kindly excuse me for that. Non-smokers, who like my profile, please contact my parents to take it forward.

I completed my BE from India and Masters from the US. Friends call me rational and straight-forward though I have my moments of utter silliness. I am quite conversational--especially with analyzing and dissecting situations. I love travelling---especially long drives and unplanned trips . I was an avid reader but haven’t been able to devote time to reading which is something I’d like to change---crime fiction and psychology are a couple genres which interest me.\n\nI am relatively career-oriented and focus a lot on my professional growth. Social issues and gender equality are a couple things I am passionate about.  I have a new-found interest in swimming .I try to stay decently fit by working out multiple days a week. I spend time reading up stuff online and watching American TV shows.  Having been exposed to varied cultural experiences, I would like to say I am more cosmopolitan in outlook and moderately traditional.\nI believe it takes a while to get to know a person. I am looking to talk to and get to know someone on a casual basis and evaluate if there is a possibility for it manifesting into a potential relationship.  I believe in going with the flow and seeing how everything works out.\n\nWhat I am looking for in a person : someone who is open-minded , ambitious , conversational and fun to be around—with similar opinions on key topics and preferably a couple similar interests(though that is not a deal-breaker).   Someone who could be my partner cum best friend for life.\nIf this interests you and if you think we might be able to hold a good conversation, please feel free to reach out.\n\n A bit about my family:\nMy parents are based in Pondicherry, India.

She is my inspiration and my greatest support. She is a very talented, honest,sensible, an admirably simple and a simply admirable personality. She is kind and polite and yet strong and pragmatic. She is an independent and broad minded girl with moral values acquired from me :P She got placed in a MNC and started working for it.Now she is following her passion for civil services and cleared the prelims and the mains exams and she wishes to pursue it in future. That is all that elders at home allow me to talk about her. But here comes the top secret- she is a foodie and locates landmarks in Chennai only with restaurants. We used to own a dog whom my sister used to call by so many funny names that can make your ribs crack. Also somehow most of the kids i try to enroll in my party end up enrolling in the attractive opposition party ( she probably bribes them). She loves travelling and according to kids, peers and elders- she is very interesting company :D Ya, i must admit she is fun. She loves to go out for a walk, enjoys nature, taps her feet to music. She taught me a lot of subject when i was in school and she is pretty good at it. She was a jack of all trades in school- academics, sports, arts. She is street smart and is a trusted adviser for family and friends. And finally she still fights with me and will go mad once she wakes up in the morning and finds out what i have done to her profile and exclaim ''Like i said, thats why one should never let the small ones interfere in such matters!'' :D Less...","name":"Bhavani","age":"26","height_feet":"5","height_inch":"5","weight":"61 Kgs / 134  lbs","mother_tongue":"Telugu","maritial_status":"Never married","body_type":"Average","complexion":"Fair","physical_status":"Normal","eating_habit":"Eggetarian","drinking_habit":"Never drinks","smoking_habit":"Never smokes","religion":"Hindu","caste":"Naidu (Caste No Bar) / Velama","country":"India","state":"Tamil Nadu","city":"","citizenship":"India","resident_status":"Chennai","education":"B.Tech.","education_detail":"MBA","occupation":"Student","occupation_detail":"Not Specified","employed_in":"Not working","annual_income":"Not Specified","family_status":"Upper middle class","father_status":"Joint Commissioner (Retd)","mom_status":"Home maker","brothers":"1 / 1 Married","sisters":"1 / Not Married","about_family":"My dad is retired joint commissioner, commercial tax dept Chennai , currently one of the conveners in a NGO, my mom - the best cook and keeps low our bad cholesterol levels, she holds a MA degree in public administration, my elder brother- a Group manager in HCL and my sister in law- a senior consultant in Juniper networks, they both make a  happy and loving family completed with my naughty little niece who is presently in charge of my sisters heart.
