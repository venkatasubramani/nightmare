I have a Masters in Biomedical Engineering and I’m currently working for UT Arlington, USA. \n\nSome of the adjectives my beloved ones use, to describe me would be these: reliable, straight-forward, caring, affectionate and mischievous. I think they are right :)\n\nI love my family the most and they mean everything to me. I’m an avid nature lover. I try my best to keep the environment clean. Some of my hobbies include reading novels, building miniature doll houses, puzzles and cooking. I’m pretty good at cooking Indian and Chinese. I’m looking forward to learning terrace gardening and also planning to grow fruits and veggies preferably in my own backyard garden. I love adventure sports and am open to trying all that exist!!! I crave learning new things and prefer keeping myself occupied most of the times...\n\nCaring and sharing make life sweeter, according to me and I have grown up seeing a beautiful bond between my parents. I would like my life partner to be someone who thinks along the same lines, who is kind-hearted, down to earth and broad minded. I would gladly travel along with him as a supportive friend and make our journey a blissful and satisfactory one! \nThanks for reading through my profile and good luck on your soul mate search.\n\nP.S: Smokers please ignore my profile and kindly excuse me for that.

I am quite conversational--especially with analyzing and dissecting situations. I love travelling---especially long drives and unplanned trips . I was an avid reader but haven’t been able to devote time to reading which is something I’d like to change---crime fiction and psychology are a couple genres which interest me.\n\nI am relatively career-oriented and focus a lot on my professional growth. Social issues and gender equality are a couple things I am passionate about.  I have a new-found interest in swimming .I try to stay decently fit by working out multiple days a week. I spend time reading up stuff online and watching American TV shows.  Having been exposed to varied cultural experiences, I would like to say I am more cosmopolitan in outlook and moderately traditional.\nI believe it takes a while to get to know a person. I am looking to talk to and get to know someone on a casual basis and evaluate if there is a possibility for it manifesting into a potential relationship.

Now that is all that elders at home allow me to talk about her. But here comes the top secret- she is a foodie and locates landmarks in Chennai only with restaurants. We used to own a dog whom my sister used to call by so many funny names that can make your ribs crack. Also somehow most of the kids i try to enroll in my party end up enrolling in the attractive opposition party ( she probably bribes them). She loves travelling and according to kids, peers and elders- she is very interesting company :D Ya, i must admit she is fun. She loves to go out for a walk, enjoys nature, taps her feet to music. She taught me a lot of subject when i was in school and she is pretty good at it. She was a jack of all trades in school- academics, sports, arts. She is street smart and is a trusted adviser for family and friends.

I have a Masters in Biomedical Engineering and I’m currently working for UT Arlington, USA. \n\nSome of the adjectives my beloved ones use, to describe me would be these: reliable, straight-forward, caring, affectionate and mischievous. I think they are right :)\n\nI love my family the most and they mean everything to me. I’m an avid nature lover. I try my best to keep the environment clean. Some of my hobbies include reading novels, building miniature doll houses, puzzles and cooking. I’m pretty good at cooking Indian and Chinese. I’m looking forward to learning terrace gardening and also planning to grow fruits and veggies preferably in my own backyard garden. I love adventure sports and am open to trying all that exist!!! I crave learning new things and prefer keeping myself occupied most of the times...\n\nCaring and sharing make life sweeter, according to me and I have grown up seeing a beautiful bond between my parents. I would like my life partner to be someone who thinks along the same lines, who is kind-hearted, down to earth and broad minded. I would gladly travel along with him as a supportive friend and make our journey a blissful and satisfactory one! \nThanks for reading through my profile and good luck on your soul mate search.\n\nP.S: Smokers please ignore my profile and kindly excuse me for that. Non-smokers, who like my profile, please contact my parents to take it forward. Thanks again :) Less...","name":"Arul Amudha","age":"26","height_feet":"5","height_inch":"3","weight":"54 Kgs / 119  lbs","mother_tongue":"Tamil","maritial_status":"Never married","body_type":"Average","complexion":"Wheatish","physical_status":"Normal","eating_habit":"Non Vegetarian","drinking_habit":"Never drinks","smoking_habit":"Never smokes","religion":"Hindu","caste":"Nadar / Hindu Nadar","country":"United States of America","state":"Texas","city":"Arlington","citizenship":"India","resident_status":"Work Permit","education":"M.S.(Engg.)","education_detail":"The University of Texas at Arlington","occupation":"Masters in Bioengineering","occupation_detail":"Engineer   Non IT","employed_in":"","annual_income":"Private Sector","family_status":"Upper middle class","father_status":"Insurance Advisor (Ex Indian Navy)","mom_status":"Teacher","brothers":"Not Specified","sisters":"1 / 1 Married","about_family":"Ours is a nuclear family - myself and my wife live in Chennai, India.
